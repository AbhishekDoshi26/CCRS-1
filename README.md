# CCRS
CCRS is a medium where citizens can raise their voices and file up the complaints. Citizens will have to register themselves with the app. Once registered, they need to login. During the time of login, an otp will be sent to their registered mobile number. After logging into the app, they can send a complaint. They need to specify the complete details of their complaint. They can also submit a supportive image to enhance the impact of the complaint. The user can track their complaints also. Once the complaint is filed, the admin and the citizen will be notified.  The admin would be the highest authority of the city. The admin will be able to view the complaints and change the status of the complaints accordingly. Once the complaint has been solved, respective citizen will get notified.
